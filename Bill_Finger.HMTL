<p>Bill Finger was a writer for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics' target=blank>DC Comics</a>, and is now recognized as the co-creator of the  super hero character: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman' target=blank>Batman</a>. DC Comics artist <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kane' target=blank>Bob Kane</a> created the original artistic design for Batman, and Bill was brought on to help write the character and setting of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City' target=blank>Gotham City</a></b>. Bill was uncredited for decades for his contributions, due to a contract Bob had with DC Comics. This led the public to believe Bob Kane was the sole creator of Batman. Bill’s legacy came to light thanks in part to Mark Tyler Noble’s book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Bill-Boy-Wonder-Secret-Co-Creator/dp/1580892892' target=blank>Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman</a>.</p>

Bill came up with the design of Batman, gave him his detective personality, and helped inspire the original artistic vision. <a href='http://www.followingthenerd.com/site/wp-content/uploads/bob-kane-batman-before-bill-finger.jpg' target=blank>Bob Kane had created a much different design before Bill's input</a>.</p>
